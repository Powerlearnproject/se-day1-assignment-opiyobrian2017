#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the art and science of building, diagnosing and maintaining software solutions that solve real-world problems. It's a discipline that focuses on the systematic development of high-quality software products using engineering principles, methods and tools.
Software engineering is important because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Development of programming languages such as C
-The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
-The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
-The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
(i) Requirements: Involves gathering and documentation of user needs and system requirements.
(ii) Requirement Analysis
(iii) Design: Detailed creation of high-level software architecture and user interface.
(iv) Implementation: Building the software according to the design specification. It involves the actual coding.
(v) Testing: Performing various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
(vi) Deployment: Release of the software product to the customer or users.
(vii) Maintenance: Updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards. It is appropriate where the scope of the project is predetermined and does not need adjustments. Agile methodology is an Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. It's appropriate where the project has chances for future updates or growth.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developer: Develop software and applications that solve real-world problems
-Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures that software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.
-Project Manager: Oversees the entire project lifecycle, ensuring the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the specified requirements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs such as Eclipse provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes.
-VCS such as Git provides a platform for tracking changes to a source code and coordinating work among team members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
(i) Changing requirements that lead to scope creep and project delay
      -Remedy: Effective communication.
(ii) Tight deadlines often lead to rushed development and compromised quality
      -Remedy: Use of agile methodologies
(iii) Technical debt accrued from shortcuts and suboptimal solutions
      -Remedy: Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: Testing individual components or modules of a software
Integration testing: Testing interaction between different components of software.
System testing: Testing the entire system/software as a whole.
Acceptance testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the user's needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of crafting precise and effective input prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate, relevant, and useful outputs. It helps AI to elicit desired responses from AI systems.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about technology.
Improved Prompt: Provide a brief overview of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, focusing on generative AI models and their impact on the healthcare industry.
Explanation:
The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the focus on a specific topic narrowing it down to the industry of interest rather than focusing on technology as a whole.
